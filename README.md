# UFOS
Using Javascript, bootstrap to make a UFO sightings page

# Overview of the Project

For this project we are building an HTML page that will allow us to pull up information from a javascript data file using filters on the page. Due to the sightings having different shapes and occurring in different areas, we used the filter method in Javascript, to show the differences.

When the client visits the website, they will see the basic opening and title with the image at the top, as the client scrolls down they will begin to see all the data and filters that are on the website(please see image below). The image below has five filters to choose from: date, city, state, country, and shape. These may be use one at a time or multiple filters can be entered at the same time to search for various UFO sitings.

# Summary

We have created a page that allows you to filter the data by: city, state, country, and shape. However, there are a couple of drawbacks in the website, one is the lattitude and longitude are not included in the search filters. Clients may want to return to the exact location were the UFO was sited. Additionally, there are no pictures included of the UFO siting on the website. Therefore, my two recommendations would be to add an API call for the latitude and longitude of the siting and a possible filter to include pictures if there are any.
